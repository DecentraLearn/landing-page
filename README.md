The Odin Project - Foundations - Project: Landing Page

This is a project to practice putting together from scratch a landing page for a product or business. It is meant as a way for me to practice working with html and css. Specifically, I used css' flex tool for most of the layout.

This website was designed for a full screen browser and is not mobile responsive as I have no idea how to do that yet lol. Still learning.
